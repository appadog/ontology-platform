# Current State

최신 총괄 상태판입니다. 총괄 에이전트는 각 wave 보고를 읽은 뒤 이 파일을 갱신합니다.

## Latest Wave

- Current wave: `wave-007`
- Overall status: `MVP 2 WAVE 6 THIN SLICE PARTIAL / FE CONTRACT SYNC REQUIRED`
- 기준일: 2026-06-17

## Latest Decisions

- Wave 5 QA evidence is accepted for MVP 1 app acceptance closeout.
- Docker CLI absence is approved as an environment exception for MVP 1 closeout. Compose smoke remains a follow-up infra gate, not an MVP 1 app acceptance blocker.
- Headless Chrome render evidence plus actual API write smoke is accepted as `INT-005` browser/manual UAT evidence. Full click automation remains a follow-up when tooling is available.
- MVP 2 implementation may begin in Wave 6, starting with contract hardening plus the first thin Backend/Frontend slices for profiling, segments, prompts, extraction jobs, and deterministic mock extraction.
- Wave 6 PM contract hardening and Backend thin slice are accepted as PASS.
- Wave 6 Frontend mock/navigation slice is accepted as PASS for mock exploration, but actual API mode remains PARTIAL until FE types/client/fixtures match `docs/api/openapi-mvp2-draft.json`.
- Provider API literal for MVP 2 thin slice is `mock`; `MockProvider` may be used as UI display label only.
- `POST /api/v1/sources/{source_id}/parse` canonical response is `SourceParseResponse`, not `SourceSegment[]`.
- `GET /api/v1/extraction-jobs/{job_id}` remains the MVP 2 detail boundary for `model_runs[]`.
- Wave 7 must close FE/OpenAPI contract mismatch before broadening MVP 2 implementation.
- `/api/v1/dashboard` is not part of MVP 1 actual API contract. Frontend actual API mode must compute dashboard data from P0 APIs or keep dashboard mock-only/P1 boundary.
- `docs/api/openapi-mvp1.json` is the MVP 1 canonical OpenAPI export artifact.
- Source delete uses internal `is_deleted` soft delete; `SourceStatus` enum is not extended for delete/archive in MVP 1.
- Relation/edge cardinality uses the full Backend/OpenAPI `Cardinality` enum in Frontend for MVP 1.
- `OntologyGraph.classes[]` and `relations[]` are optional/deprecated compatibility fields, not canonical required fields.
- `hana-style-component` install script delay and npm audit findings are P2 dependency hardening follow-up, not MVP 1 release blockers.
- MVP 1 UI style foundation is tracked as `FE-012`; this is a minimal token/primitive/layout/status/hana-adapter guide, not a large redesign.
- 모든 역할 에이전트는 `.agents/skills/handoff-reporting/SKILL.md`를 작업 시작 전 읽고, 종료 시 지정된 `docs/handoffs/wave-XXX/{ROLE}_REPORT.md`에 보고서를 남긴다.
- 작업 완료는 보고서 작성까지 포함한다.

## MVP 1 P0 Demo Flow

```text
프로젝트 생성
→ ontology draft version 생성
→ class/property/relation 작성
→ graph 조회
→ CSV/Excel 업로드
→ preview 확인
```

## Current Blockers / Follow-ups

| Area | Blocker | Linked IDs |
|---|---|---|
| MVP 1 App Acceptance | Closed. Backend regression, OpenAPI freshness, actual FE-to-BE smoke, ontology authoring smoke, source preview smoke, and UAT evidence accepted. | INT-001, INT-003, INT-005 |
| Infra | Docker CLI 부재로 Compose 실제 `up` 검증 미수행. 총괄 환경 예외 승인, 후속 gate로 유지. | BE-002 |
| Browser Automation | Headless render evidence accepted. Full click automation is useful but no longer blocks MVP 1 closeout. | INT-005 |
| MVP 2 Backend Thin Slice | Backend profile/parse/prompt/job/mock extraction/candidate/evidence smoke PASS. | BE2-001~BE2-007, BE2-009 |
| MVP 2 FE Contract Sync | FE `SourceProfile`, `SourceSegment`, `SourceParseResponse`, `PromptVersion`, provider literal, candidate/evidence DTOs do not fully match OpenAPI. | FE2-001~FE2-006, INT2-001~INT2-003 |
| MVP 2 Evidence Fixture | `INVALID_EVIDENCE_REFERENCE` policy is documented but lacks deterministic runtime fixture/test hook. | PM2-003, PM2-005, BE2-007, INT2-002 |

## Next Gate

1. PM: Confirm provider literal/display split, parse response shape, retry dedupe scope, and invalid evidence fixture policy.
2. Frontend: Re-sync MVP 2 types/client/fixtures/screens against `docs/api/openapi-mvp2-draft.json`; send provider `mock`.
3. Backend: Keep backend API stable, add/clarify examples and invalid evidence fixture/test hook if PM approves.
4. QA: Re-run INT2-001/002/003 actual FE-to-BE smoke after FE sync; keep INT2-004 regression.
